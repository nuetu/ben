 I have many aspirations. I want to write a hit single. I want to be a popular clothing designer. I want to design an award-winning video game. I want to write and direct a movie. I want to publish a novel. 
  I want a lot. But I know I have to start small, start somewhere. I figured that by learning to code, coding my own website, and setting up my own server, I could broadcast to a select few the ineresting pieces of my life. 
  This website is my first attempt at completing my aspirations. Some day, I hope I can achieve all of the above. I will work to complete them, but untill then, this is my beginning.
